Server Actions Extension
========================

The server actions extension allows you to view a log of events and actions
taken on a server. First do a GET $endpoint/servers/{server-id}/os-instance-actions
to see a list of the actions, then you can show more details with GET
$endpoint/servers/{server-id}/os-instance-actions/{request-id}.
