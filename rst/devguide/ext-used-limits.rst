Used Limits Extension

Extends limits to include information about the absolute limits that are
currently used. Returns absolute and rate limit information, including
information about the currently used absolute limits.

Absolute and rate limits are part of the core API. For more information about limits, 
see :doc:`limits`. The used limits extension adds attributes to the response body that 
show how much capacity is currently being used.
