General API Information
=======================

API v2 is defined as a RESTful HTTP service that uses all aspects of the HTTP protocol, 
including methods, URIs, media types, and response codes. To request next generation 
Cloud Servers services, you must first issue an authentication request to the Rackspace 
Cloud Identity Service, which is an implementation of the OpenStack Keystone Identity 
Service v2.0.

API v2 supports JSON request and response formats.
