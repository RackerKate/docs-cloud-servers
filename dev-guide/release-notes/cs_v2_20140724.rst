What's new
~~~~~~~~~~

-  OnMetal servers introduced.

   OnMetal extends Rackspace Cloud Servers to support single tenant,
   bare metal, high-end hardware specialized to deliver outstanding
   performance for the key workloads typically seen in web applications.
   These servers can be provisioned within minutes via the Cloud Servers
   API, similar to any other cloud instance.

   Significant differences between virtual cloud servers and OnMetal
   cloud servers include:

   -  OnMetal servers are created using special flavors and images.

   -  Private networks are not currently available for OnMetal servers.

   -  OnMetal servers must be created using keypairs, and the admin
      password provided at creation should be neither used nor modified.

   -  Some server actions, like Rebuild, Resize, Rescue, and so on, are
      not applicable to OnMetal servers.

-  Updated images and flavors tables.
