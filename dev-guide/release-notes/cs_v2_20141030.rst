What's new
~~~~~~~~~~

-  With the earlier introduction of OnMetal and two new
   workload-optimized flavor classes, the name of the Performance flavor
   classes is looking more and more out of alignment. Additionally,
   Rackspace's focus has shifted away from performance and towards the
   Managed Cloud. So, we'd like to rename the Performance flavor class
   to align with the OnMetal, Compute and Memory naming, to clearly
   reflect the value we’re delivering to our customers, and to reduce
   confusion as we grow the Cloud Servers product line.

   The Performance 1 flavor class will become the first version of the
   General Purpose flavor class, and Performance 2 will return to its
   conceptual roots as the first version of our I/O flavor class. This
   should help clear up confusion between the Performance 1 and 2 flavor
   classes, while also putting Performance 2 on the same footing as the
   Compute and Memory flavor classes. (General Purpose v1 will behave
   exactly as Performance 1 does today, with regard to API actions, and
   I/O v1 will behave the same as Performance 2.)

-  Additionally, we will propose a separate plan to End of Sale the
   current Standard flavor class. Until that plan is enacted, though,
   all customers will still see the Standard flavor class.

-  In summary, here are the changes that will happen:

   1. We will add two new flavor classes: General Purpose v1 (like
      Perfomance 1 but with combined data and system disk) and IO v1
      (like Performance 2).

   2. We will hide two existing flavors classes (Performance 1 and
      Performance 2) from Reach, but we'll leave them visible in the
      API.

   3. We'll launch 2 brand new flavor classes: Compute v1 and Memory v1.

   4. At a future date, we will end-of-sale the Standard, Performance 1
      and Performance 2 flavor classes.
