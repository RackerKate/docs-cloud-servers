API |contract version| updates, June 2, 2015Â 
----------------------------------------------

What's new
~~~~~~~~~~

Removed XML examples. The XML serialization format for API request and
response bodies is no longer supported by OpenStack. In order to stay in
consistent with OpenStack (and industry trends in general), Rackspace
has deprecated the use of XML request and response bodies. New code
using the Compute API should not use XML, and current programs using XML
should prepare for the end of XML support. The date when Rackspace will
remove XML support from the Compute API will be announced soon.
