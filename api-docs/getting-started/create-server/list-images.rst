List images
------------

Before you create a server, list images so that you can choose one for your new server.

After you choose an image, copy its image ID. You use this image ID when you create the 
server.

The sections are also organized by example type. To simplify your path through this 
topic, decide whether you prefer nova-client or cURL examples.

**Next step:** Choose one of the following methods:

-  :ref:`List images with nova<list-images-with-nova>`
-  :ref:`List images with cURL<list-images-with-curl>`
