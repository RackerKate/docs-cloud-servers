Deleting server
---------------

When you no longer need your cloud server, delete it.

It can take a few minutes to delete your server. After the server is deleted, it no longer 
appears in the list of servers.

The sections are also organized by example type. To simplify your path through this 
topic, decide whether you prefer neutron-client or cURL examples.

**Next step:** Choose one of the following methods:

-  :ref:`Delete server with nova client <delete-server-with-nova>`
-  :ref:`Delete server with cURL <delete-server-with-curl>`
