Deleting a virtual interface
-----------------------------

If your server no longer needs the virtual interface, you can delete and detach it from 
the server.

To delete and detach your virtual interface from a server, you need the ID of your server 
instance and the ID for the virtual interface. After you delete the virtual interface, it 
no longer appears in the list of virtual interfaces for your server.

**Next step:** Choose one of the following methods:

-  :ref:`Delete a virtual interface with nova <delete-virt-interface-with-nova>`
-  :ref:`Delete a virtual interface with cURL<delete-virt-interface-with-curl>`
