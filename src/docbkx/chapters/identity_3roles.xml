    <title>Role based access control</title>
    <para> Role Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts access to the capabilities of Rackspace Cloud services, including the
        Cloud Servers API, to authorized users only. RBAC enables Rackspace Cloud customers to specify which account users of
        their Cloud account have access to which Cloud Servers API service capabilities, based on roles defined by Rackspace
        (see <olink targetdoc="cs-devguide" targetptr="RBAC_global_roles_table_3">Table 8, “ Multiproduct (Global) Roles and
            Permissions”</olink>). The permissions to perform certain operations in Cloud Servers API – create, read, update,
        delete – are assigned to specific roles. The account owner user assigns these roles, either global (multiproduct) or
        product-specific (for example, Cloud Servers), to account users. </para>

        <title>Assigning roles to account users</title>
        <para> The account owner (identity:user-admin) can create account users on the account and then assign roles to those
            users. The roles grant the account users specific permissions for accessing the capabilities of the Cloud Servers
            service. Each account has only one account owner, and that role is assigned by default to any Rackspace Cloud
            account when the account is created. </para>

        <title>Resolving conflicts between RBAC multiproduct and custom (product-specific) roles</title>
        <para> The account owner can set roles for both multiproduct and Cloud Servers scope, and it is important to
            understand how any potential conflicts among these roles are resolved. When two roles appear to conflict, the
            role that provides the more extensive permissions takes precedence. Therefore, admin roles take precedence over
            observer and creator roles, because admin roles provide more permissions. </para>
